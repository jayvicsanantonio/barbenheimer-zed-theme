# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
Everything ships from `themes/barbenheimer.json`, which defines the Barbenheimer Bunker, Dreamhouse, and Nuclear Sunrise variants expected by Zed's theme schema. Preview images that accompany marketplace listings live in `assets/` (`barbenheimer-*.webp`). Extension metadata resides in `extension.toml`; update the version there before publishing. Shared documentation, licensing, and conduct guidelines stay at the repo root.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
`zed extension package .` builds a distributable archive for local testing. Use `zed extension publish .` only after validating a release build; it pushes the version declared in `extension.toml`. During theme tweaking, run `zed extension dev --dir .` to hot-reload the theme in a local Zed instance without re-packaging.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Keep JSON indented with two spaces and fields ordered to mirror the current grouping (surface colors, editor colors, scopes). Color keys follow Zed's dotted namingâ€”reuse the existing patterns rather than inventing new namespaces. Image assets should remain WebP, lower-case, hyphen-separated filenames. When updating metadata, prefer plain English, sentence-case descriptions.

## Testing Guidelines
There is no automated test suite; rely on visual QA. Launch Zed with `zed extension dev --dir .`, switch through all three variants, and verify syntax scopes, UI chrome, terminal colors, and accessibility contrast. Update `assets/` screenshots whenever palettes change so the marketplace listing reflects the current look. If you alter schema fields, validate against `https://zed.dev/schema/themes/v0.1.0.json` to catch typos early.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Commit messages in this repo are short, imperative statements (e.g., "Fix Barbenheimer Bunker"). Follow that style and keep each commit scoped to a focused change. For pull requests, describe the motivation, list notable color or structural changes, and attach before/after screenshots from Zed. Link GitHub issues when relevant and confirm that `extension.toml` and packaged artifacts stay in sync before requesting review.
